# Incident Diagram ü•≥‚òÑÔ∏è
IncidentDiagram is a tool that leverages LLMs to help visualize details in a post-incident analysis or post-mortem.

The initial prototype assumes that the incident review mentions the components that were affected.

```
$ incidentdiagram -f incident.txt  -u https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Lab/EventOrOutage/tree/main -m claude-3.5
.
.
Chart generated in artifacts/incident.md
```

## Get started üöÄ
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
cat "A lot of details about the incident" > incident.txt
incidentdiagram -f incident.txt  -u https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Lab/EventOrOutage/tree/main -m claude-3.5
```
**Requires:**
* Python > 3.10
* OpenAPI/Gemini/Anthropic API Key

## Examples üìñ
Here are a few ways you can use IncidentDiagram:
* `incidentdiagram -f incident.txt  -u https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Lab/EventOrOutage/tree/main -m claude-3.5` ‚Äì will download the code from github and generate a diagram based on the incident summary in incident.txt
* `incidentdiagram -f incident.txt  -u https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Lab/EventOrOutage/tree/main -m gpt-4o` ‚Äì Use a different model
* `incidentdiagram -iu www.postmortems.com/1345  -u https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Lab/EventOrOutage/tree/main -m claude-3.5` ‚Äì Download the incident summary from a URL and generate a diagram
