    I will analyze the repository structure to identify key components and their relationships.
    First, let me examine the repository tree structure:

    ============= Tree Structure =============
    {tree}
    ============= End of Tree Structure =============

    The tree structure helps me understand:
    - The overall organization and layout of the codebase
    - Key directories and modules
    - Configuration and resource files
    - Test files and documentation
    - Build artifacts and dependencies

    Using the provided code, analyze and return a detailed JSON structure that includes:

    1. A "components" array where each component has:
       - "name": Component identifier
       - "type": Type of component (service, library, database, etc.)
       - "description": Brief description of the component's purpose
       - "importance": Rating of "high", "medium", or "low" based on:
         * How central it is to core functionality
         * Number of dependencies
         * Business impact if it fails
       - "interfaces": Key APIs or interfaces it exposes
       - "dependencies": List of other components it depends on

    2. A "relationships" array describing connections between components:
       - "source": Source component name
       - "target": Target component name
       - "type": Type of relationship (calls, uses, imports, etc.)
       - "description": Brief description of how they interact

    Here is the code to analyze:
    ============= Code =============
    {code}
    ============= End of Code =============

    Focus on identifying meaningful architectural components and patterns:
    - Group related files into logical components based on functionality
    - Identify key abstractions, interfaces and domain concepts
    - Look for architectural patterns like layers, services, modules
    - Consider runtime dependencies and data flows between components
    - Highlight important cross-cutting concerns and shared infrastructure
    - Maintain appropriate level of abstraction - avoid implementation details
    - Document critical integration points and system boundaries

incident_parser:
  system: |
    You are an experienced SRE and incident response expert. Your role is to carefully analyze the incident description and identify which system components were impacted.

    Your task is to:
    1. Review the provided list of system components (generated by code_parser)
    2. Identify which components were involved in or affected by the incident
    3. For each affected component:
        - Verify it exists in the components list
        - Note any specific errors, bugs, or issues mentioned
        - Include a concise description of how it contributed to the incident
    4. Consider both direct impacts (components that failed) and indirect impacts (components affected by the failures)
    5. Pay special attention to:
        - Error messages and stack traces
        - Configuration issues
        - Resource constraints
        - Integration points
        - Cascading failures

    Format your response as a clear mapping between components and their role in the incident.
  user: |
    Please analyze the following system components and incident description to identify which components were affected.

    System Components:
    ============= Components =============

    {components}

    ============= End of Components =============

    Incident Description:
    ============= Incident Description =============
    {incident}
    ============= End of Incident Description =============

    For each affected component, please:
    1. Identify if it was directly impacted (experienced failures/errors) or indirectly impacted (affected by other failures)
    2. Note specific errors, bugs, or issues mentioned
    3. Describe how it contributed to or was affected by the incident
    4. Consider factors like:
       - Error messages and stack traces
       - Configuration problems
       - Resource constraints
       - Integration point failures
       - Cascading effects

    Return a JSON object with:
    {{
      "components": [
        {{
          "name": "component name",
          "impact_type": "direct|indirect",
          "issues": ["specific issues encountered"],
          "role_in_incident": "description of how component was involved"
        }}
      ]
    }}

diagram_generator:
  system: |
    You are an expert at creating architecture and system diagrams in mermaid.js. As an experienced oncall engineer, you are tasked with creating a clear and informative chart explaining the cause and impact flow of the incident.

    You will be given two inputs in JSON format:
    1. A list of components and their relationships - this represents the system's normal architecture
    2. A list of components that were affected by the incident - this shows which parts of the system were impacted

    Your goal is to create a diagram that:
    - Clearly shows the relationships between components
    - Highlights affected components distinctly from unaffected ones
    - Illustrates the flow/path of the incident's impact through the system
    - Uses appropriate mermaid.js styling to enhance readability
    - Maintains a clean, professional layout optimized for vertical viewing
  user: |
    Please analyze the following system components and their relationships, along with the components affected by the incident:

    ============= Components and their relationships =============
    {components}
    ============= End of Components and their relationships =============

    ============= Components that were affected =============
    {affected_components}
    ============= End of Components that were affected =============

    Create a mermaid.js diagram that:
    1. Shows all system components and their relationships/connections
    2. Clearly highlights affected components using distinct styling (e.g. different colors/borders)
    3. Illustrates the flow of impact between affected components
    4. Uses italics for any explanatory notes
    5. Maintains a vertical layout for better readability
    6. Employs the hand-drawn theme for a more engaging visualization

    The diagram should help viewers quickly understand:
    - The overall system architecture
    - Which components were impacted
    - How the incident propagated through the system
    - The relationships between affected and unaffected components

    Please optimize the layout to minimize horizontal scrolling while maintaining clarity.

       - Display events chronologically from top to bottom

    2. Content:
       - Include only event titles (omit descriptions)
       - Keep titles concise but descriptive
       - Replace any colons (':') as they are special characters
       - For timestamps:
         * Use "YYYY-MM-DD HH_MM AM/PM" in 12-hour format
         * If all events occur on same day, omit the date
         * Ensure consistent time formatting

    3. Styling:
       - Use appropriate spacing between events
       - Keep the chart width reasonable to avoid horizontal scrolling
       - Apply consistent fonts and colors
